# n! means n × (n − 1) × … × 3 × 2 × 1

# For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × … × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
# and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

# Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

# (This is actually one of those cases where a functional language like Clojure or JavaScript can be useful.
# See if you can solve it in a functional language.)
